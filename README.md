This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon SQL error related to the unexpected handling of NULL values in comparison operations within the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement.  The `bug.sql` file shows the problematic query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.  This example highlights the importance of considering NULL values when writing SQL queries to avoid unexpected or incorrect results.
